***IMPORTANT!*** 
Find the branch containing your name and fetch it locally.
Note that we will consider ***ONLY*** your generated branch when evaluating the progress and the final result.
Please ***do NOT create other branches***.
When your solution it's in a good shape, please ***TAG*** your branch (git command: ***git tag <tag_name>***). (the name of the tag is not important ~ e.g. umg-canditate-name). When a tag is pushed an automatic synchronization process starts.After the tag is pushed, your branch will be moved to into another private repository and it will be deleted.
Make sure you ***push the tag ONLY when you consinder your test is ready to be reviewed. Deletion of the branch cannot be reverted***! 
You can use the following git command to push a tag:
***git push origin <tag_name>***

Time to solve the exercise: ***3 hours***.
